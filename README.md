Statlandia
==========

The goal of this exercise to create a real time statistics portal with two constantly updating graphs. A suggested layout is provided below for inspiration, but need not be followed. The first graph is a time series view of a fictional quanity for a 60 second window; the second graph is a pie chart view of the sub-totals over all time.

The data required for both these graphs can be found using the API locations /data/time_series and /data/pie_chart. The time series data is updated 4 times a second. The pie chart data contains the lifetime totals for each category. Feel free to bring any libraries or frameworks you need to make this page look good.

The final result should be a compressed directory that, when unpacked, can be viewed using the provided node.js script. Have fun!
