The goal of this exercise to create a real time statistics portal with two constantly updating graphs. A suggested layout is provided below for inspiration, but need not be followed. The first graph is a time series view of a fictional quanity for a 60 second window.  The second graph is a pie chart view of the sub-totals over all time.
        <p>
The data required for both these graphs can be found using the API locations
<a href="/data/time_series">/data/time_series</a> and <a href="/data/pie_chart">/data/pie_chart</a>.  
The data source is updated periodically at 4 times a second.  Feel free to bring any libraries or frameworks you need to make this page look good.
        </p>
        <p>
The final result should be a compressed directory that, when unpacked, can be viewed using the provided node.js script. Have fun!
